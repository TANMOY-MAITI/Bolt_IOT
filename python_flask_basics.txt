The first line imports the Flask module and creates an instance of the Flask class, 
which represents the web application. The name of the application is passed as a parameter.


app = Flask(__name__)


The next line defines a route for the application, 
which is the URL that the user will access to interact with the application. 
In this case, the route is set to "/", which is the root URL. 
The methods parameter specifies that the route can handle both GET and POST requests. 


@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])


The hello() function is the view function for this route. When the user accesses the root URL,
the view function will be called. In this case, the hello() function is simply initializing an empty string output. 
If the request method is POST, meaning that the user has submitted a form with data, 
the function retrieves the value of the 'components' field from the form using request.
form['components'] and calls a function named generate_tutorial() with that value.


def hello():
    output = ""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        components = request.form['components']
        output = generate_tutorial(components)


The next route is defined for the application. 
The route is set to '/generate' and can only handle POST requests. 


@app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])


The generate() function is the view function for the /generate route. 
When the user submits the form on this route, 
the function retrieves the value of the 'components' field from the form using request.
form['components'] and calls the generate_tutorial() function with that value. 
The generate() function then returns the output of generate_tutorial().


def generate():
    components = request.form['components']
    return generate_tutorial(components)
            
        

Finally, the code checks if the application is being run directly by checking if the _name variable is set to '__main_'. 
If it is, the app.run() function is called to start the Flask development server. 
The server will listen on all available network interfaces ('0.0.0.0') and port 8080.


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)


The Final Code Snippet:


app = Flask(_name_)
@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def hello():
    output = ""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        components = request.form['components']
        output = generate_tutorial(components)
@app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])
def generate():
    components = request.form['components']
    return generate_tutorial(components)
if _name_ == '_main_':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
